## Session 1: Class Orientation  

In our opening session, we will review the syllabus and design of the subject and introduce ourselves to each other.

## Session 2: On Not Defining “Fan” & “Fan Culture”         

This class, we want to understand how definitions work and why a single authoritative definition of “fan” or “fan culture” isn’t necessary, while also advancing a shared understanding of the range of object/practices of analysis for the class.
